        <h2> Bonuses and Promotions at Vulkan Casino</h2>
        <p>Vulkan Casino offers lots of bonuses that you can claim. Below, I've detailed a few of the most
          appealing
          ones, but there'll be much, much more in your promotions tab. Here, you'll find promotions
          tailored to you
          that will be easy to claim.</p>
        <p>As well as this, if you sign up for email and SMS marketing you'll receive regular smaller promotions
          too.
          For me, it was well worth signing up for emails.</p>
        <h3>Welcome Bonus</h3>
        <p>The Vulkan Vegas welcome offer is nothing if not an attention-grabber! It comes in three installments across
          your first three deposits, promising up to €1,500 and 130 free spins in total. Let's break it down into
          parts:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-block">
          <li>1st deposit from €10 to €500 bonus (120% match) plus 70 free spins to use on Big Bass Splash </li>
          <li>2nd deposit from €15 to €500 bonus (150% match) plus 30 free spins in Book of Fallen </li>
          <li>3rd deposit from €15 to €500 bonus (120% match) plus 50 free spins in Book of Tribes </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There's a 40x wagering requirement on the bonus cash and a 30x wagering requirement on the free spins
          winnings. There's also a win cap of 5x your deposit amount.
        </p>
        <p>You have 5 days to use the bonuses and complete the rollover before they expire. You must make all three
          deposits within the first 48 hours of signing up to the site in order to claim the full bonus.</p>
        <h3>Saturday Quest Bonus </h3>
        <p>The Saturday Quest bonus is great for bettors on a budget and high rollers alike. If you deposit at least
          €10, five separate times during the day on saturday then you'll become eligible for a bonus. The bonus
          amount
          is based on the average of your five bonuses (so will typically be around 20% of the total deposit amount. The
          bonus amount is capped at €1,000.)</p>
        <h3>Loyalty Programme </h3>
        <p>If you're a sucker for a loyalty programme then Vulkan Vegas will not disappoint. This casino boasts
          an impressively structured 99-level loyalty program divided into ten different stages. </p>
        <p>To make your way through the stages, just wager real money on your favourite games. For every €5 you spend,
          you receive 1 point. These points can be exchanged for real money at an increasingly good rate, the higher up
          the levels you climb. For example, at level one the rate is 500:1, at level ten, it's 100:1.s</p>
        <p>As you climb through the levels you also unlock better and better bonuses. Cashback is perhaps the biggest
          perk, rising from 0% at level 1, to 12% at level 10. You can claim weekly reload bonuses, reaching a 200%
          deposit bonus at level 10 and you can claim birthday bonuses too. </p>
        <p>Everybody is automatically entered into the loyalty program, so it's well worth keeping an eye on
          those points and cashing them in from time to time.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
          Tip: Live casino games do not count towards loyalty points. If you want to accrue points then focus on the
          other game types. A complete list of excluded games is available in the loyalty section of the Vulkan Vegas
          website.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Weekly Bonus</h3>
        <p>Let's take a look at some of the loyalty programme bonuses in more detail. The weekly bonus becomes
          available
          at the second 'status' or level 10 and above. These bonuses give you a deposit match bonus once
          per week. </p>
        <p>At level 10, it's a 70% deposit match bonus and 25 free spins on 3x3 Hold the Spin by Gamzix.
          There's a €10
          minimum to claim this bonus.
        </p>
        <p>At level 90 and above it's a 200% deposit match bonus and 100 free spins on Vulkan of Olympus by
          Pragmatic
          Play. There's a €50 minimum to claim this weekly bonus.
        </p>
        <h3>Cashback Offer</h3>
        <p>Sometimes even your best laid plans go a little awry, but at Vulkan Vegas, they're happy to take out
          some of
          the sting. Their weekly cashback offer begins at level 10 and increases with each level. </p>
        <p>At level 10, you can claim 3% cashback on your losses (over a week long period), while at level 90 and above
          you can claim 12% cashback on your losses (over the week too).
        </p>
        <p>While this might not seem like all that much, cashback is a super effective way to really stretch out your
          bankroll.</p>
        <h3>Birthday Bonus</h3>
        <p>Another great loyalty programme perk is the birthday bonus. As the name suggests, you receive this once per
          year on your birthday. These bonuses begin at level 10, or 'status 2' with prizes ranging from
          €30 up to €200,
          or free spins from 50 in number to 100.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wrapper-text-block">
        <h2>Bonus Terms and Conditions at Vulkan Vegas
        </h2>
        <p>As with any casino bonus, you'll always find terms attached. I've had a thorough look through
          all of the
          Vulkan Vegas terms and conditions and there's nothing particularly unusual there. I'm happy that
          this casino
          provides good value for money and will pay out players who win, as long as they follow the bonus terms.
        </p>
        <p>With that in mind, let's take a look at some of the most important terms to take care to follow when
          claiming
          a bonus at Vulkan Vegas casino.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-block">
          <li><b>Wagering Requirement:</b> The wagering requirements at Vulkan Vegas vary according to the bonus that
            you choose. Typically they sit between 30x and 40x.
          </li>
          <li><b>Expiry Dates/Validity Period:</b> Unless it's otherwise specified the bonuses at Vulkan Vegas
            Casino are valid for 5 days only.
          </li>
          <li><b>Game Exclusions:</b> Only slot games count towards wagering requirements, all other games are excluded.
          </li>
          <li><b>Game Contributions:</b> Select slot games count between 15% and 50% towards wagering requirements. A
            full list
            of these can be found in the 'Bonus Terms' page, linked in the footer of every page at Vulkan
            Vegas casino.
          </li>
          <li><b>Maximum Bet:</b> When using a casino bonus, there's a maximum bet of €5. This includes when you
            double
            a bet, so keep this in mind when playing.
          </li>
          <li><b>Win Cap:</b> If you claim a no-deposit bonus, there's a €500 cap on your winnings. This means
            whatever you win above €500 with a no-deposit bonus is forfeited upon withdrawal.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="wrapper-text-block">
        <h2>Game Selection at Vulkan Vegas Casino</h2>
        <p>Vulkan Vegas has more than 2,500 games from so many providers I won't even try to name them all!
          Below, I'll
          break down the different game categories along with what you can expect to find. Then, we'll dig into
          the
          software providers so that you can see if any of your favourites appear on the list. Spoiler alert: they
          almost certainly will.
        </p>
        <h3>Slots</h3>
        <p>Vulkan Vegas really excels in slots, offering over 2,000 titles from renowned providers like NetEnt,
          Pragmatic Play, Yggdrasil, Quickspin, and Microgaming. You can click 'slots' in the filter tab
          to look through the whole catalogue, or you can search by provider or theme. This filtering option is really
          helpful if, for example, you know you love fishing themed slots.</p>
        <p>Some personal favourites from the catalogue include:</p>
        <ul class="list-block">
          <li><b>Book of Dead </b> - Embark on a treasure-filled adventure with Rich Wilde, exploring ancient tombs
            packed with free spins and huge wins. </li>
          <li><b>Big Bass Bonanza </b> - Cast your line for big catches in this fishing-themed slot, where free spins
            and wilds reel in huge wins. </li>
          <li><b>Gates of Olympus</b> - Spin through mythical realms, unlocking godly bonuses with electrifying gameplay
            and massive multiplier wins. </li>
          <li><b>Sweet Bonanza</b> - Candy-coated visuals and tumbling symbols create sweet gameplay with generous
            multipliers and tasty payouts. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The filtering options were useful, but it would be great to see Vulkan Vegas introduce additional sorting
          options like volatility or RTP.</p>
        <h4> Progressive Jackpots</h4>
        <p>If you're after a big win, then the progressive jackpot slots selection at Vulkan Vegas isn't
          bad!
          Frustratingly, you can't filter by progressive jackpot slots, but you can find options in the Pragmatic
          Play
          Drops & Wins lineup. Titles like the below should provide ample opportunity for those hunting down big wins:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-block">
          <li>Starlight Princess </li>
          <li>Buffalo King Megaways</li>
          <li>The Dog House Megaways </li>
        </ul>
        <H3>Table Games</H3>
        <p>The table game section is surprisingly large at Vulkan Vegas! There are all the classics including blackjack,
          roulette, baccarat, and poker. It's a clear favourite with roulette fans, as there's a whole
          section dedicated
          just to this game with plenty of different variants to choose from.
        </p>
        <p>It was nice to see a good selection of blackjack games as well, plus a few options for poker and video poker.
        </p>
        <h3>Exclusive and Insta Games </h3>
        <p>One standout feature was Vulkan's collection of exclusive "Insta" games like Aviator, JetX, and
          Plinko. These quick-win games offer totally unique mechanics and are fun, if a little gimmicky.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wrapper-text-block">
        <h2>Vulkan Vegas Sportsbook</h2>
        <p>Vulkan Vegas has a much smaller sports offering than its casino, but there's still more than enough
          for most bettors. All of the major sports are covered, with standard odds and a good range of live betting
          options. There's a generous sports betting bonus too. The area it really stands out is esports betting,
          where the odds are head and shoulders above the competition.</p>
        <h3>Sports Bonuses</h3>
        <p>Vulkan Vegas offers a slightly smaller selection of sports bonuses than its casino ones, but there are still
          plenty worth claiming. Let's take a look at them! </p>
        <h4>Sports Welcome Bonus</h4>
        <p>The sports welcome bonus comes in two parts:</p>
        <ul class="list-block">
          <li>1st deposit between €10 and €300 as a 100% deposit match. </li>
          <li>2nd deposit between €15 and €300 as a 150% deposit match.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The maximum amount you can withdraw as winnings is 5x the bonus amount and there's a 20x wagering
          requirement
          for each step of the bonus and you can only wager on single bets at odds of at least 1.9 or multiple bet where
          each leg is at least 1.4.</p>
        <p>Personally, I think the 20x wagering requirement is a bit steep. It&#39s typical to find around 10x at other
          sportsbooks. However, the minimum odds requirement and win cap is right in line with the competition.
        </p>
        <h3>Sports Markets</h3>
        <p>Vulkan Vegas has 24 sports markets including all of the most popular sports, as well as some more niche
          offerings like water polo, bandy, and floorball. This puts it at the top end of available sports, meaning it
          should provide odds on the vast majority of markets.</p>
        <p>Their live betting section is strong too, at the time of my midweek review there were 11 different sports I
          could bet on and almost 100 matches.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, there's an entire section dedicated to esports. It's clear that Vulkan Vegas is a leader in
          this area, offering markets on titles such as: Dota, Counterstrike, Fortnite, Valorant, and Hearthstone.
        </p>
        <h3>Sports Odds</h3>
        <p>Sports odds at Vulkan Vegas are generally middling. For major markets they're right in line with the
          competition, while for the smaller ones some are pretty good (Futsal) and some aren't so great (Table Tennis).

        <h2>How to Sign Up to Vulkan Vegas Casino </h2>
        <p>Signing up at Vulkan Vegas was effortless, with the option to use Google, Facebook, X, or even TikTok to
          speed up the process. From start to finish, including claiming the welcome bonus, it took me less than five
          minutes. If you'd like a step-by-step guide then look no further.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-block no-marker">
          <li><b>Visit the Vulkan Vegas Casino homepage.</b> Click register in the top right hand corner. You'll be
            asked for
            your email address and desired password, as well as choosing your currency. If you want to speed things up
            even further, choose Google, Facebook, X, or TikTok to use your account info from there.</li>
          <li><b>Complete Your Personal Details.</b> Enter your date of birth, address, and select if you have a promo
            code, or want to receive promotional mail (this is a good idea, as Vulkan Vegas often sends out email
            exclusive promos). You'll need to tick to confirm that you're over 18. </li>
          <li><b>Confirm Your Email.</b> You'll be sent an email as part of the welcome process, click the link in it to
            confirm your registration. </li>
          <li><b>Choose Your Welcome Bonus.</b> Within an hour, you'll need to activate the welcome bonus (if you want
            to claim it). Once you've decided on the bonus you want to claim, make a qualifying deposit.</li>
          <li><b>Start Playing!</b> With your first deposit made, you're ready to start playing. Good luck!</li>

        <h2>How Vulkan Vegas Stacks up on Mobile </h2>
        <p>So often I get to this stage in a review and have very little to say, but that's not the case here. Vulkan
          Vegas has clearly prioritized mobile gaming. The mobile site is perfectly set up for gaming, with games
          adjusting automatically to your screen size and menus that are easy to navigate.</p>
        <p>If you're a keen gamer then the good news is they also have dedicated apps for both Android and iOS, though
          crucially, they are different.
        </p>
        <h3> Vulkan Vegas Android App</h3>
        <p>The Vulkan Vegas Android app is the better option of the two, purely because of the exclusive in-app bonuses.
          These used to be much more common, so it's great to see a fresh site bringing them back.</p>
        <p>You can download the Android app straight from the Vulkan Vegas website. It offers all of the same great
          games as the website, but perfectly tailored to smaller screens. This app also works great on tablets too.</p>
        <h3>Vulkan Vegas iOS App</h3>
        <p>The iOS app doesn't benefit from the same exclusive bonuses as the Android app, though there is still usually
          one mobile exclusive bonus available. It is available to download exclusively from the app store and works on
          any iOS device (iPhone or iPad) that's running iOS 12.0+ and above. </p>
        <p>Just like the Android app, all of the same games are available to play and they all fit different screen
          sizes seamlessly.

        <h2>Payments at Vulkan Vegas Casino

        <p>Let's start off with the positives. Making payments at Vulkan Vegas casino is very straightforward. There's
          lots of choice in both deposit and withdrawal methods and the minimum amounts are low enough for even those on
          a tight budget. </p>

        <h3>Payout Times at Vulkan Vegas</h3>
        <p>The payout times at Vulkan Vegas can get a little confusing depending on how much you want to withdraw. Their
          terms specify that (as long as you've completed the KYC) payouts up to €499 will be approved within 12 hours.
          This is pretty speedy and considering their choice in payment providers, the external processing time should
          see you receive your winnings in around a day.
        </p>
        <p>As you make larger requests, the approval time changes. Up to €4,999 your approval should be approved within
          48 hours, up to €29,999 within 96 hours, and €30,000 should also be approved within 96 hours, though they
          reserve the right to take max 30 business days to investigate. </p>

        <h2>Customer Support at Vulkan Vegas Casino </h2>
        <p>One area where Vulkan Vegas really stands out to me is its customer service. It's easiest to contact them via
          live chat, where you answer a series of questions and if your query can't be answered by a chatbot, you're
          connected to a customer service assistant. The whole process is over in about five minutes and if you're
          connected to a real person, they're super helpful.</p>
        <p>If there's no urgency for your query then you can contact them by email at
          <a href="mailto:support@vulkanvegas.com">support@vulkanvegas.com</a>. This email is monitored 24/7 and you
          should
          receive a reply within 24 hours, but in my experience it's usually much quicker. Interestingly, there's a
          whole
          separate email account for complaints (
          <a href="mailto:complains@vulkanvegas.com">complains@vulkanvegas.com</a>), showing how open they are to
          resolving issues.
        </p>
        <p>If you're happy to solve your own problems then there are plenty of pages explaining bonus terms, payment
          terms, and plenty more in the footer of every page. </p>
        <p>While there'll always be someone who prefers to use a phone number, for me, the customer services options
          were plenty varied and genuinely useful.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wrapper-text-block">
        <h2>Responsible Gambling Tools </h2>
        <p>Vulkan Vegas has a surprisingly strong selection of responsible gambling tools. These are available in your
          account settings but not that easy to find. </p>
        <p>You need to head to your account settings by clicking on the person icon in the top right hand corner. Then,
          click on 'Settings' at the bottom of the menu and on the page that pop's up, scroll right to the bottom and
          you'll find 'Responsible Gambling' in greyed out writing. Click this and you can modify your responsible
          gambling settings.
        </p>
        <p>Below are the different tools that you can use to help you gamble responsibly at Vulkan Vegas:</p>
        <ul class="list-block no-marker">
          <li><b>Activity limit:</b> Restricts the amount of time you can spend playing games each day.</li>
          <li><b>Deposit Limit:</b> Restricts total amount of money you can deposit each day. </li>
          <li><b>Loss Limit:</b> Restricts how much you can lose within one day. </li>
          <li><b>Wager Limit:</b> Restricts how much you can bet within one day.</li>
          <li><b>Take a break:</b> Stops you accessing your account for a set number of days. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can change all of these limits yourself in your account settings, but you can only change them once per
          day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wrapper-text-block">
        <h2>Security and Licensing at Vulkan Vegas Casino </h2>
        <p>Vulkan Vegas is first and foremost a safe casino to play at. It holds a Curacao license, meaning it's
          licensed for remote gambling throughout Europe. Though it doesn't have a country-specific license, the Curacao
          eGaming License is sufficient for Vulkan Vegas to operate legally. </p>
        <p>As well as a license, it employs strong SSL encryption to protect your data. It also partners only with
          reputable payment providers and well-known game developers. Its commitment to responsible gambling and
          excellent customer service cements the fact that this is a trustworthy casino. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="wrapper-text-block">
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Vulkan Vegas is a seriously solid choice for players in the EU. It's casino has a broad selection of games
          and the list of partnered providers is like a roll call for the best in the industry. While the sportsbook
          offering is a little sparse, if you're into esports betting then this site is one of the best in the business.
        </p>
        <p>Bonuses are generous and particularly plentiful, though the 5 day expiry date could be improved upon. With
          around the clock customer service, an arsenal of responsible gambling tools, and more payment methods than you
          could possibly get through, Vulkan Vegas would be a wise choice for almost any kind of casino player. </p>
